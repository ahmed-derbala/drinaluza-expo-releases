# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Added a `disableAnimations` prop to `SmartScreenHeader` and enabled it on the `/updates` screen to remove all header animations (linear progress bar, pulsing skeleton loaders, and title fade-in).
- Refactored form and details screens (including `/auth`, `/profile`, `/businesses/[slug]`, `/businesses/[slug]/edit`, `/products/create`, `/businesses/[slug]/products/[slug]`, and `/businesses/[slug]/products/[slug]/edit`) to use `SmartKeyboardSafeView` to prevent keyboard overlap on input fields across platforms.
- Refactored `/search` and business products lists to use standard React Native `FlatList` components.
- Modified `SmartScreenHeader` to ensure the back button is always visible in `headerLeft` (defaulting to `/feed` when there is no screen in history) on all non-root screens, while keeping it hidden on main root tab screens by checking the router's current `pathname` (following Expo Router best practices).

### Fixed
- Fixed asynchronous state layout measurement timing lag in `SmartKeyboardSafeView` by utilizing a synchronously updated mutable ref (`viewportHeightRef`).
- Fixed ScrollView layout truncation on `/auth` screen by moving centering styles from `contentContainerStyle` to an inner `View` wrapper.
- Fixed Android keyboard covering the welcome form on `/auth` and blocking scroll by switching `KeyboardAvoidingView` from `behavior={undefined}` to `behavior="height"`, adding dynamic bottom padding based on keyboard height, and replacing `flexGrow: 1` with `minHeight` on the inner content wrapper so it always overflows the shrunken viewport.

### Removed
- Removed the custom `KeyboardSafeView` and `KeyboardSafeFlatList` components (`src/core/KeyboardSafeView`) to align with standard React Native event propagation and cross-platform layouts.
- Rewrote `SmartScreenHeader` to premium production-grade quality, incorporating a left-aligned layout for back button, title, and subtitle, and a fixed-width right section (`176px`) to completely guarantee Zero Layout Shift during navigation.
- Added a pulsing `Animated.View` skeleton block loader in `SmartScreenHeader` to replace title/subtitle text during loading states (`isLoading`/`loading`), preserving exact layout constraints and applying a smooth fade-in micro-animation when loading completes.
- Implemented a reusable `headerActions` prop in `SmartScreenHeader` to resolve predefined keys (`'search'`, `'notifications'`, `'cart'`, `'settings'`, `'refresh'`, `'scanner'`) and custom configuration objects, avoiding hardcoded action button JSX inside screen files.
- Refactored `FeedScreen` to use the new reusable `headerActions` configuration.
- Modified `UpdatesContext` to keep all downloaded APK files in local storage by disabling the automatic pruning of older version files, allowing users to view and manage all cached files.
- Modified the `/updates` page to show the cached APK installers list on all platforms when files exist, rather than restricting it to Android.
- Fixed the "Share Link" button on the updates screen to use React Native's native `Share` API instead of `expo-sharing` (which only supports sharing local file URIs).
- Modified the updates download flow to download files to a `.tmp` path first and rename them to `.apk` only upon successful completion, ensuring incomplete or partial downloads are ignored in the cached installers list.
- Fixed Android startup redirection to `/updates` when a newer version is available by delaying the layout transition until the stack navigator mounts, and by performing a version redirection check in the root index component.

### Added
- Created a reusable, high-fidelity, New Architecture (Fabric) compatible `SmartKeyboardSafeView` component under `src/core/smart-keyboard-safe-view` to handle keyboard avoidance, scroll containment, and automatic scrolling to focused text inputs on iOS, Android, and web.
- Added `loading` translation key to local translation files (`en`, `fr`, `ar`, `tn_latn`, `tn_arab`).

## [1.23.3] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- Created a reusable `SmartScreenHeader` component that supports responsive layouts, safe area top insets, and customizable header actions.
- Introduced pre-configured composed action buttons (`BackButton`, `NotificationsButton`, `SearchButton`, `CartButton`, `SettingsButton`) as static sub-components of `SmartScreenHeader`.
- Added a premium linear progress loading indicator to `SmartScreenHeader` utilizing performant `Animated` transforms.
- Enhanced `SmartScreenHeader` to be fully compatible with React Navigation custom header specifications (`options`, `route`, `navigation`, `back`).

### Changed
- Configured `SmartScreenHeader` as the default custom `header` renderer across root navigation files (tabs layout, businesses layout, products layout, users layout, and dashboard layout), ensuring the kebab menu is rendered on every screen.
- Refactored `AuthScreen` to utilize the new unified `SmartScreenHeader` component, reducing code duplication and manual inset calculations.
- Refactored the updates screen to utilize `SmartScreenHeader` and tied the checking/downloading states to the loading progress bar.
- Refactored `performStartupCheck` in the root layout to verify the fresh local APK lists, correctly installing ready downloaded APKs (which are higher than the current version) if the current version is equal or higher than the latest version, while maintaining app entry on check failure or web startup.

## [1.18.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- Rewrote the Authentication Screen (`/auth`) from scratch using the premium `SmartScreenHeader`, registering a dynamic "Reset App" action inside the `SmartKebabMenu`, and maintaining complete `KeyboardSafeView` scroll containment.
- Integrated page reload automation via `window.location.reload()` into the web updates screen refresh button, ensuring exact disabled-state conditional comparisons.
- Implemented smart badge toggle checks inside `SmartKebabMenu` that hide the updates badge unless a remote update is downloadable or a cached APK is installable.
